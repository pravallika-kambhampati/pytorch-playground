Tensors, similar to arrays and matrices. 
To encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the modelâ€™s parameters.
Can run on GPUs or other hardware accelerators. 
Tensors and NumPy arrays can often share the same underlying memory, eliminating the need to copy data.
Tensors are also optimized for automatic differentiation.

Operations on Tensors
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html
Each of these operations can be run on the GPU (at typically higher speeds than on a CPU).
