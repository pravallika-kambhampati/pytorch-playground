This repository contains code to train a neural network using the FashionMNIST dataset. The FashionMNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of 10 different classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot. The goal is to build a neural network model using PyTorch that can classify input images into these 10 classes.
